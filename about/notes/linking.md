# `pluridoc` linking


linking requires a ', a pair of brackets [] with the link content,
and a pair of paranthesis () with the id or title (if it is unique) of the linked plurid plane

    <<<
    plurid content

    plurid content '[link](id: 123) plurid content

    plurid content '[link](title: 123) plurid content
    >>>


the linking is difficult to maintain when writing the document by hand, and it is better to use the application to let the handling of ids to the machine
